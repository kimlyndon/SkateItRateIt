# Skate It/ Rate It
## The App for DIY Skatepark Enthusiasts
#### Udacity iOS Developer Nanodegree Capstone project

## Background
  Skateboarding is not a crime! In fact, it is an artistic and creative way to express yourself and challenge your abilities. Skate parks built by professionals are in short supply , highly regulated, and often close at dark. Skateboarders tend to carry a bad (often misleading) reputation. 
  Skate culture has become more collaborative and supportive regarding unused spaces where local businesses allow private citizens to build a Do It Yourself skate spot. Skaters are free to come and go, create additional features, and skate free of regulations and time limits. SkateIt/RateIt allows users to display where these DIY spots are located so others may enjoy them, too. 
  
## User Experience

### Map Scene
  When SkateIt/RateIt loads, the user will see a map that, as more users plot destinations, will be populated with pins. The user's current location will be identified by the blue circle. There is a button to "Get Gear" that leads the user to California Skateboard Supply, an e-bay store that sells all things skate. User can navigate back to the map with the "Back" button. 
  If the user is currently at a "Spot," he/she can drop a pin via the "Drop In" button. Should the user know where the spot is, he/she can also perform a long press drop pin action. 
  Tapping a pin will give the user the option to get directions to that location, or take the user to the RateIt view. 
  
### RateIt Scene
  The user can rate the spot with stars as well as add a generic review from a selection that spans from negative, to neutral, to positive. Ratings are cumulative and the average rating review will show in this scene under the "⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️." The RateIt view has the option to return to the map by pressing "Done," or uploading a picture via the "Grab Pic" button which will segue to the Photo Editor. The RateIt scene also has a collection view of persisted photos associated with each location. As more users upload photos, the collection will grow. There is currently no option to remove photos but this option will be available in a later update.
  
### Photo Editor
  This scene allows the user to choose from the camera option to take a photo, choose an image from the photo album, share that image to social media or through e-mail and text, and save the image to the persisted collection view. The user can navigate back to the previous screen and then back to the map if preferred, depending on the order in which the user decides to use the app.
