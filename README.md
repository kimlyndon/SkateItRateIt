# Skate It/ Rate It
## The App for DIY Skatepark Enthusiasts
#### Udacity iOS Developer Nanodegree Capstone project

## Background
  Skateboarding is not a crime! In fact, it is an artistic and creative way to express yourself and challenge your abilities. Skate parks built by professionals are in short supply , highly regulated, and often close at dark. Skateboarders tend to carry a bad (often misleading) reputation. 
  Skate culture has become more collaborative and supportive regarding unused spaces where local businesses allow private citizens to build a Do It Yourself skate spot. Skaters are free to come and go, create additional features, and skate free of regulations and time limits. SkateIt/RateIt allows users to display where these DIY spots are located so others may enjoy them, too.
